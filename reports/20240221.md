*   Questions (10-15 min)
    
    *   Will we be graded on documentation? What are some things we should ensure regarding our documentation?
        
    *   What requirements do we have for distributing the app?
        

Progress and Issues
-------------------

This week, we found the Gemini API and decided to use that instead of having to run mistral locally so that the LLM part of our pipeline works more quickly. Now that our classification is working, we got various other information from the LLM. For example, if the item is classified as “donate”, the LLM will return a list of 3 places that the item can be donated to. Using prompt engineering and response parsing, we were able to successfully return more complex information to the backend, which in this coming week will be displayed in the frontend. As for the frontend, we are almost finished with text-classify and the ability to upload images.

With regards to issues, on the LLM side, it has been difficult to engineer the prompt such that it returns the specifications for how to recycle an object in a consistent format that can be parsed. So this will require more prompt engineering to resolve.

We also got our backend hosting set up using AWS, including CD to automatically deploy to staging on a correctly formatted tag. One related issue and potential blocker is that to publish our app on the Google Play store, Google requires a 14 day long closed beta test. If we assume that the course website calendar correctly lists the final release deadline as Feb 26th, we will not have enough time to release the app to the general public before the deadline.

### Progress and Issues

This week I was able to continue working on the objectives I laid out for the week That includes the classify text stretch goal and the upload image. I am on pace to complete this by tonight (Wednesday) and continue on this week's goals, which is to adapt to the new format output from the LLM. The only issue I have had this week would be time, I had a few exams this week and wasn't able to complete much in the beginning but picked it up these past couple days.

### Previous Week’s Goals

*   LLM should send location-aware responses to front end (3 days, due Tuesday)
    
*   Look into how to improve speed of LLM (2 days, due Friday)
    

### Progress and Issues

This week Aaron found a much faster LLM API we can use, so I worked on code that not only classifies an item sent to it, but also gives extra information depending on the object. For example, for items that can be donated or dropped off at a special disposal site, I wrote code that gets 3 locations in Seattle that the user can go to, and used prompt engineering to format the responses in a standardized way, enabling me to parse the responses into a list that is then sent to the backend. We would also like for the LLM, when an item is to be recycled, to give specifications on how it should be (for example, it should not be wet or crumpled, etc). However, currently, the LLM is not giving a standardized format that I can parse into a list of items where each item is a specification. Thus, I need to work on more prompt engineering this week in order to get the LLM response in a specific format that can be parsed.

### Plans and Goals

*   Edit backend api to account for extra information sent by the LLM (1 day, due Friday)
    
*   Prompt engineering to get a standardized response from LLM regarding recycling specifications that can be parsed into a list (2 days, due Sunday)
    
*   Carry out some hallway usability tests (2 days, due Tuesday)
    
*   Add more integration tests (2 days, due Saturday)

### Previous Week’s Goals

*   Set up hosting and CD for backend
    
    *   Create AWS EC2 instance for staging
        
    *   Set up CD to deploy on git tag
        
*   Create tests for backend with images
    
    *   Feeds image into algorithm and expects the correct waste type
        
*   Support other team members in improving model accuracy and speed
    

### Progress and Issues

To start off this week I did a little bit of experimenting with the Google Gemini API. After determining that it is free to use and would fit our needs, I made a simple drop-in replacement for the previous llm python module so we could compare using the gemini api vs locally running mistral. From that point, Aneesha improved my code and expanded the functionality of the llm to offer more detailed suggestions.I also spent a lot of time this week on setting up hosting for the backend. I created an AWS EC2 instance, then manually set up nginx and gunicorn to serve our app from AWS. I also explored using AWS Lambda, but decided to stick with EC2 so we could store the images we receive from reporting incorrect classifications. I then created a deploy script in a github workflow to automatically deploy the backend anytime we push a tag starting with “stage”.

Lastly, I did a little bit of preparation for publishing our app on the Google Play Store. I created a developer account, created the app on the play developer console, and read up on some of the requirements for publishing on Google Play. During this process, I encountered one significant issue: Google Play requires a 14 day long closed beta test before an app can be released to the general public. If we assume the course website calendar is correct and the final release is due on Feb 26th, then there is no way we can have a published app on the Play Store by that time.

### Plans and Goals

*   Optimize hosting and deployment
    
    *   Modify deploy script to reuse up-to-date pip installs and avoid removing entire repo for every deploy
        
        *   1 day, Friday
            
    *   Add a second gunicorn instance and nginx config for a production api running alongside the staging api
        
        *   2 days, Saturday
            
    *   Add info to readme and requirements document
        
        *   1 day, Monday
            
*   Add more tests
    
    *   3 days, Monday

### Previous Week’s Goals

*   Clean up the model code
    
    *   3 days
        
    *   The current code on the main branch is pretty messy, mainly just scraped together to make the beta due date. It could be a lot better which would not only help in future testing, but can also be made more modular so switching out image classifiers is easier.
        
*   Add more tests to the model
    
    *   2 days
        
    *   Following from the previous goal, the new code would be easier to write tests for so I’m planning on having better test coverage for it.
        
*   Begin documentation for CV code
    
    *   1 day
        

### Progress and Issues

This week I mainly made the code surrounding the model cleaner. In particular this meant making it easier to run the model (now you only need to call one function which does everything instead of having to then deal with error checking and parsing the response) and adding documentation which makes what each function is doing clearer. Especially during integration when the LLM code has similar function names, this will hopefully make it easier for outside developers to understand how things fit together. I additionally changed how the api key is provided, now it will try to read from a .env file instead of reading from a global environment variable, which was a piece of feedback from the peer review.

This also made my testing easier; each function now has a more defined role and tests can be more specific. I am still in the process of adding more test cases, but it is an improvement from before. I am currently slightly blocked on working the .env file into the CI without exposing the api key in it, right now it is very annoying to have to remember to delete its contents before each commit. That being said, it's not that much of an issue and I can avoid it with diligence.

### Plans and Goals

*   Continuing adding tests
    
    *   1 day
        
    *   Just a few more that I want to add for edge cases
        
*   Improve the CV model
    
    *   3 days
        
    *   Now that I have a better code base, it should be easier to switch to a better model. Right now the biggest bottleneck in terms of accuracy for our app is the CV model, I want to have a better one if possible

### Previous Week’s Goals

*   Collaborate on Classify Text UI Integration (due by 2/17): In line with the team's goal to work on classifying text to work like images, I will collaborate with Sulaiman to integrate this functionality into the UI. This involves designing and implementing a user-friendly interface for text input and displaying classification results.
    
*   Further UI Enhancements (due by 2/17): I plan to continue refining the UI, focusing on responsiveness and alignment across all Android devices. This includes optimizing the layout for different screen sizes and resolutions to ensure a consistent user experience.
    

### Progress and Issues

I've been working on organizing and planning the UI design tasks. Despite some time constraints with shifting my work online, I've continued to collaborate with Sulaiman to integrate text classification functionality into the UI smoothly. Additionally, I've continued refining the UI, focusing on enhancing responsiveness and alignment across various Android devices. However, managing time effectively has been a challenge, leading to slight delays in completing tasks earlier in the week.

### Plans and Goals

*   Prioritize addition of "About Me" page for comprehensive user guidance (1 day, by Friday)
    
*   Further update UI design for enhanced user experience (2 days, by Friday)
    
*   Ensure consistency and usability across various screen sizes and resolutions (2 days, by Sunday)
