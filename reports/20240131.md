Agenda
------

-   Scrum stand-up (5 min)

-   Should our main branch of the Github repo be protected?

-   Should we aim to use an actual android device and not just rely on the emulator?

Progress and Issues
-------------------

This week we were able to make some reasonable progress in our development. We were able to make some UI designs for our MVP features on figma. Then we set up the environments for both the frontend and backend. The frontend was set up through Flutter with a starter app code. We connected this to Android Studio and successfully emulated the starter app. Then we set up the backend with a simple FastAPI application that sent a JSON message. We pushed these to our repo in order to then work on the testing environment and CI. We set up testing and CI for the frontend portion of our app and we are working on the testing for the backend right now.

===================

Sulaiman:
---------

### Previous Week's Goals

-   Design a UI interface for RecycleRight on Figma with Julia to include all the MVP features and potentially the stretch goals as a separate design.

-   MVP Design (2-3 days)

-   Review and finalize the UI design w team confirmation (few hours)

-   Setup the Flutter architecture for the frontend component with Julia

-   Break down UI into Flutter components (5 hours)

-   Setup Flutter environment, everyone can access (1 day)

-   Create new Flutter project w/ some architecture (1 day)

-   Setup backend architecture w/ FastAPI (1 day)

### Progress and Issues

This week I was able to create a UI design on figma of our MVP features at a general level. I created this using Android interfaces. Me and Julia created separate ones so that way we have more to choose from, in terms of design. The main portion of what I did is in the setup of the frontend and backend of RecycleRight. I started off by downloading Flutter and installing Flutter SDK while ensuring it's properly configured in my system PATH. I then created a new flutter project which generated a template app in our frontend directory. I downloaded Android Studio and set that up as well and got the flutter app to run on an emulator. I made some slight changes to our app, like the name of the app and titles. After exploring Dart and the Flutter framework, I moved on to the backend. I installed FastAPI and Uvicorn, then added a basic FastAPI application in main.py which is a simple hello world program that returns a JSON response. I did not encounter any issues this week, outside of figuring out how to set up a camera simulator in the emulator which is what I am working on now.

### Plans and Goals

-   Setup app structure, due by Sunday 2/4

-   Split our application into Flutter components which each might be a different file, and there will be a main file/component that will be in charge of the navigation of other components

-   Setup main page, due by Monday 2/5

-   Implement the main page which will be a camera interface the moment the app opens

-   Include a title and any other small design elements

-   Set up Endpoints?

-   Improve UI design?

Aneesha:

### Previous Week's Goals

-   Work with the team to finalize the project architecture (2 days, by Friday)

-   Modify my use case in the team requirements document to be more specific (30 mins, by Friday)

-   Set up our backend test structure and automate testing through Github (3 days, by Tuesday)

### Progress and Issues

This week, I did research on the different possibilities for the test-automation infrastructure, evaluating pros and cons. Eventually, as a group we decided on using the flutter framework's unit and widget tests to test the frontend as well as pytests to test the backend. I am currently in the process of setting up the testing for the backend, and I will complete it by tomorrow's meeting.

### Plans and Goals

-   Set up our backend test structure (1 day, by Thursday)

-   Set up API endpoints (3 days, by Saturday)

-   Set up LLM access

-   Find a service that we can use and set up API access (3 days, by Tuesday)

### Previous Week's Goals

-   Work with the team to finalize the project architecture by Friday

-   Modify my use case in the team requirements document to be more specific

-   Finish by Friday

-   Setup testing and CI for the frontend project

-   Goal to finish by Tuesday

-   Due Wednesday

### Progress and Issues

This week my primary job was to set up testing and CI for the frontend project. After Sulaiman created the starter app code, I added a simple example unit test to the project in addition to the example widget test that was already provided. I then worked with Github Actions to set up continuous integration. As a result, anytime code is pushed, the app is built and the tests are run automatically. I also set up badges in the project's readme files to provide a quick look at our test status. However, as I was working on this I forgot that we had not yet discussed which CI service we wanted to use, so this is still just in another branch and will be merged if we decide as a group to use Github Actions.

### Plans and Goals

-   Create a small CV testing dataset, due by Friday 2/2

-   Find about 100 images of common waste items and label each with their waste type in a standard format

-   Will be used later for validation of our algorithm.

-   Test pre-trained object detection models, due by Monday 2/3

-   Use the CV testing dataset to manually run detection and pass results to ChatGPT

-   Determine if the categories of the pre-trained models will be suitable for our needs

Victor:

### Previous Week's Goals

-   Finish the architecture and design

-   Choose a CV model or open source project

-   Begin working on testing and CI

### Progress and Issues

This week we finished up our architecture document which has helped me move forward on researching and testing CV models. In particular I've been looking at existing open source classifiers, and have found multiple training datasets we can pull from if we decide on that path. To that end I've started creating a classifier, right now I'm testing whether or not transfer learning from resnet will be good enough for our purposes. Unfortunately I wasn't able to work on the testing code due to a personal emergency; I will continue working on that this week as it should not be a problem moving forward.

### Plans and Goals

-   Continue working on transfer learning classifier

-   See if it is a viable path for our app

-   3 days

-   Continue working on testing/CI code for the backend.

-   More of the backend has been completed, we should make sure that our testing code is keeping up with it

-   2 days

Julia:

### Previous Week's Goals

-   Research the best ways to implement a front-end with Flutter.

-   Design a user interface (UI) for our app RecycleRight.

### Progress and Issues

This week, I focused on researching Flutter and its capabilities to ensure our frontend is both efficient and user-friendly. I explored Flutter widgets and layouts that could be useful for our app.Sulaiman and I designed a UI for RecycleRight using Figma. Our focus was to create an intuitive and accessible interface that would incorporate all the MVP features and potentially some stretch goals. One of the challenges I faced was ensuring that the UI design is adaptable across different screen sizes and devices. Flutter is well-suited for this, but it requires careful planning and testing.Another issue was learning how to integrate the UI design with the backend functionalities. 

### Plans and Goals

-   I plan to refine the UI design. This may involve tweaking the layout, color scheme, or element placement for better user experience and alignment with backend functionalities.

-   Develop the main page of the app, which will feature a camera interface upon opening. (2/5)
