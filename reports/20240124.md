**Team report:**

**Previous Week Goals**

First week doing a report.

**Agenda w/ Jason**

Stand up (5 min)



* Update on where we are and what we have updated.

Questions (10-15 min)



* Are we graded on how many stretch goals we hit?
    * Are the stretch goals we have feasible or too easy?
* How specific should we be in our MVP, specifically for how long the app should take/how accurate it is?
* Can we steal a CV model from Github? Or integrate other open source models through API calls?
* Review revised MVP
* Developing an android app when some team members have windows/android and others have mac/ios.

**Progress and Issues**

We made a git repository for our app and figured out the potential layout for our application, frontend, backend, cv, and ml. We also updated the MVP goals and stretch goals in our living document along with deciding on developing for solely Android devices. First of all, we narrowed down a few stretch goals and moved the rest to our “extra stretch goals” in a different document. We also rearranged our major features to only include those that are necessary to accomplish the main project goals, finalizing down to 4 core features.

We also did some initial testing with ChatGPT to verify that it could identify how best to dispose of items, and in the initial testing, we learned that it could categorize items into recycle, compostable, and landfill correctly. However, with special items, there were some problems at times where it would for example incorrectly not categorize phones into “special” but rather landfill. However, we will do some more prompt-engineering in the future to do further testing. We also did some research on frameworks to use for our frontend to help finalize our architecture and design plans.

Currently, we are unsure whether the stretch goals we have are the appropriate level of difficulty, and we have a list of questions we would like to ask the TA regarding the changes we have made to our requirements document. 

**Plans and Goals**

* Finalize the architecture and design for our app **Everyone**
  * A full description of the technology used and how they interact
  * 2 days by Friday
* Testing & CI 
  * Set up our test structure and automate testing through Github
  * Frontend: **Aaron**
  * Backend: **Aneesha & Victor**
  * 3 days (by Tuesday)
* UI Design & Layout  **Sulaiman & Julia**
  * Design a layout for all the MVP features on Figma (By Saturday)
* Start setup for Flutter **Sulaiman & Julia **(By Wednesday after UI Design is done)
* Start setup for backend system **Sulaiman**
  * Create initial project and basic api structure
  * 2 days (by Wednesday)
* Flesh out use cases in Requirements Document **Everyone**
  * Add a more specific user and list their unique steps in more detail such that it shows the usefulness of our core features

Sulaiman:

**Previous Week Goals**

First week doing a report.

**Progress and Issues**

This week I was able to do some research on the potential frameworks for us to use in our project. The focus remains on React Native vs Flutter, but we realize that Flutter may be better compatible when a camera is involved. I was also able to better understand our MVP features when we came together as a team and filtered them down. I also help with the setup of our github repo, more specifically explaining our goals/mission for our app and the roles of the team members directly on the Readme. To end the week, I worked on the living document with the team along with the status report.

**Next Week's Goals**



* Design a UI interface for RecycleRight on Figma with Julia to include all the MVP features and potentially the stretch goals as a separate design.
    * MVP Design (2-3 days)
* Review and finalize the UI design w team confirmation (few hours)
* Setup the Flutter architecture for the frontend component with Julia
    * Break down UI into Flutter components (5 hours)
    * Setup Flutter environment, everyone can access (1 day)
    * Create new Flutter project w/ some architecture (1 day)

Aneesha:

**Previous Week’s Goals**

First week doing a report.

**Progress and Issues**



* I worked on narrowing down the main, stretch, and extra stretch goals based on the feedback given by the TA along with the rest of the team. I also did some initial testing with ChatGBT with various prompts to see how well it classifies objects into recycle, compostable, landfill, and other. I noticed that for some “other” items, they were misclassified as landfill instead of special, but I will do some more prompt engineering this week to play around with that. I also did research on the pros and cons of Android vs iOS development, and in the end, we settled on Android as a team.

**Next Week’s Goals**



* Work with the team to finalize the project architecture (2 days, by Friday)
* Modify my use case in the team requirements document to be more specific (30 mins, by Friday)
* Set up our backend test structure and automate testing through Github (3 days, by Tuesday)

Aaron:



* First week doing a report.
* Progress:
    * This week I mostly did research. A large part of this was research into various frontend frameworks to determine the ease of use for the camera on react-native, flutter, and native Android, and I determined that Flutter has built-in support for the camera. I also did a little bit of research with ChatGPT and testing how well it can classify objects into the correct waste type.
* Goals for the next week:
    * Work with the team to finalize the project architecture by Friday
    * Modify my use case in the team requirements document to be more specific
        * Finish by Friday
    * Setup testing and CI for the frontend project
        * Goal to finish by Tuesday
        * Due Wednesday

Victor:

First week doing a report.

Progress:

This week I created and planned a layout for our Github repository. I also looked into open source computer vision projects that are attempting to classify waste that we could potentially use. In particular there is another Github project also called RecycleRight that classifies images of waste that we might be able to pipe into a LLM depending on our architecture. I was stuck in regards to my research because we do not have our plan for architecture completed.

Goals:



* Finish the architecture and design
    * A detailed plan of the technology we will use and how they interact, at least enough that I can continue researching
    * 2 days
* Choose a CV model or open source project
    * A CV model that we can at least test with and integrate 
    * 2 day
* Begin working on testing and CI
    * A test model that we can use to test the front and back ends of our app
    * 2 days

Julia:

**Previous Week Goals**

First week doing a report.

**Progress and Issues**

This week I mostly read up about react native and flutter. Researched the best way to successfully implement front end and practices for connecting the front and back end seamlessly. I also researched CVs and LLMs as it would be good knowledge for me to have a deeper understanding of ML. My goals for the upcoming few weeks: 

**Next Week’s Goals**



* I plan on connecting with Sulaiman and start by researching and implementing some UI designs for the MVP. **(2 days)**
* Finish the architecture design** (2 days)**
* Setup the Flutter environment w/ Sulaiman **(2 days) **
