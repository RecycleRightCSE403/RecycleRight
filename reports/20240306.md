Progress and Issues
-------------------

This week we were able to close out our final implementation of RecycleRight. We completed our last main feature (stretch goal) which is the ability to classify uploaded images from gallery or files. We also added a customized google link for items classified as ‘donate’ or ‘special’. We were also able to dramatically enhance our UI. Cleaning up, documenting, and refactoring our code was also another goal we completed. Also, we updated our main ReadMe to be more informative and organized for both users and developers. Polishing up our requirements document was also on the agenda and we got to that as well. All in all, we wrapped up our product, tested it, and we are ready for our final release.

### Previous Week’s Goals

*   Frontend (2 days due Friday)
    
    *   Complete upload pictures feature 
        
    *   Complete google link feature
        
    *   Enhance error handling
        
    *   Add many tests for frontend when possible
        
*   Update documentation for developer installation
    

### Progress and Issues

This week I was able to complete my goals for the frontend. I completed the upload pictures feature which allows a user to classify an image from their gallery or the internet for disposal. I was also able to complete the google links feature which displays a link for disposal sites for items classified as ‘donate’ or ‘special’. We enhanced the error handling as well to make sure we show correct and informative error messages in the client and server side. I tried my best to add more frontend tests but I believe that manual testing visually worked great, outside of the backend mock tests. We were also able to update the documentation as well. We are ready for our final product demo!

### Progress and Issues

This week I worked on ensuring our requirements document is up-to-date, worked on the presentation, and added google links for items classified as donate and special. I also in general did some debugging when it was necessary to get our final GitHub release ready.

### Progress and Issues

This week I did some debugging on the deployment process for both the frontend and backend. There were some incorrect addresses and processes that meant that the released version of the frontend didn’t correctly communicate with the backend, so fixing that meant that we could actually allow external users to use our app. I also redid the readme and added a user’s guide to help users install and use the app. Lastly, I added more tests and linting to our CI system.

Victor:

### Previous Week’s Goals

*   Discuss with everyone how we want to change the backend
    
    *   1 day
        
    *   I need to discuss with Sulaiman and Aneesha what exactly we want on the frontend and what is flexible to change given our small amount of remaining time
        
*   Make corresponding changes to backend
    
    *   2 days
        
*   Practice final presentation and begin making slides
    
    *   3 days
        

### Progress and Issues

This week we made small changes to the backend and ended up writing a lot of test cases. I had previously written tests for the CV code, so I went ahead and wrote some for the ML code and the backend api. We are having persistent issues with those tests though, it seems like the LLM we are using has a fairly low number of requests we can send per minute, and I constantly hit it while testing. This is annoying, especially when merging pull requests as we have one run of tests when the request is made, and another when the changes are merged in. Despite this limitation, having the tests are more beneficial than not, and we’ve been able to work around this issue.

### Progress and Issues

This week I asked and received feedback from the team with insights about the updated UI design. I was able to make the application more user friendly and engaging. The feedback was for the color scheme which I then followed up with the requested changes. I also worked on adding documentation to all of the front end programming. One issue I encountered was when I pulled the updated main branch before I was able to update my documentation branch which in turn got me to lose all my progress. But then I was able to start back up and get a merge request in for my team to approve.
