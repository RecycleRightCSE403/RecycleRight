### Previous Week’s Goals

*   Frontend (1 day by Thursday afternoon)
    
    *   Complete text classify feature and test
        
    *   Complete upload pictures feature and test

*   Backend (1 day by Thursday afternoon)
    
    *   Work on new features API calls and ensure it works 
        

### Progress and Issues

This week I was able to adapt the parsing of the frontend with the new output from the LLM. I set up different cases and specialized the output accordingly. I was able to complete the text classification feature as well and tested it out. Also I am almost complete with the upload pictures feature and plan to finish that here in the next day or two. I did not have any blockers or issues. Going forward this week I want to complete the upload pictures feature and complete the google link feature. I also plan on adding more testing and enhancing our error handling.

### Plans and Goals

*   Frontend (2 days due Friday)
    
    *   Complete upload pictures feature 
        
    *   Complete google link feature
        
    *   Enhance error handling
        
    *   Add many tests for frontend when possible
        
*   Update documentation for developer installation

### Previous Week’s Goals

*   Edit backend api to account for extra information sent by the LLM (1 day, due Friday)
    
*   Prompt engineering to get a standardized response from LLM regarding recycling specifications that can be parsed into a list (2 days, due Sunday)
    
*   Carry out some hallway usability tests (2 days, due Tuesday)
    
*   Add more integration tests (2 days, due Saturday)
    

### Progress and Issues

This week I worked on some prompt engineering to get a standardized response from the LLM regarding recycling. I also worked on writing more tests, although I need to continue writing more thins week. Finally, I made sure that the LLM code is well-documented. There are currently no particular issues.

### Plans and Goals

*   For items classified as donate and special, add links to google search (2 days, due Friday)
    
*   Update our requirements document (2 days, due Saturday)
    
*   Update READ.me file for backend so it is easier to follow (2 days, Saturday)
    
*   Ensure that error cases are all solid (2 days, Sunday)
    

Aaron:

### Previous Week’s Goals

*   Optimize hosting and deployment
    
    *   Modify deploy script to reuse up-to-date pip installs and avoid removing entire repo for every deploy
        
        *   1 day, Friday
            
    *   Add a second gunicorn instance and nginx config for a production api running alongside the staging api
        
        *   2 days, Saturday
            
    *   Add info to readme and requirements document
        
        *   1 day, Monday
            
*   Add more tests
    
    *   3 days, Monday
        

### Progress and Issues

This week I worked on finalizing the hosting setup. I spent some time figuring out the nginx configuration to allow us to host two versions of the backend on the same AWS EC2 instance, and then created the CI/CD workflow to automatically deploy both based on tags that were pushed. I also created a workflow that automatically creates a github release with an android apk as an artifact whenever a tag with a version number is pushed. There are still some things to figure out to make that process smoother such as setting dependencies and fixing some bugs in the deploy process, but they should be easy to accomplish this week.

### Plans and Goals

*   Fix deploy script issues and set dependencies
    
    *   1 day, Friday
        
*   Create user guide for installing the app
    
    *   1 day, Saturday
        
*   Add more tests
    
    *   3 days, Monday
        
*   Work on final demo and presentation
    
    *   3 days, Wednesday

### Previous Week’s Goals

*   Continuing adding tests
    
    *   1 day
        
    *   Just a few more that I want to add for edge cases
        
*   Improve the CV model
    
    *   3 days
        
    *   Now that I have a better code base, it should be easier to switch to a better model. Right now the biggest bottleneck in terms of accuracy for our app is the CV model, I want to have a better one if possible
        

### Progress and Issues

This week I finished polishing and adding tests to the CV code and successfully merged into main. While I had initially planned on continuing to improve the model, after some discussion with the team we decided that it wasn’t the most valuable use of my time, and I’ve since began working on other parts. In particular we are planning on changing some of the backend functions to allow the frontend to display the result of the CV model to hopefully catch errors sooner. I also made a bandaid fix to the CV model not detecting items by reducing the confidence threshold necessary to return a positive. This took a bit longer than expected, largely due to poor documentation of the CV api.

### Plans and Goals

*   Discuss with everyone how we want to change the backend
    
    *   1 day
        
    *   I need to discuss with Sulaiman and Aneesha what exactly we want on the frontend and what is flexible to change given our small amount of remaining time
        
*   Make corresponding changes to backend
    
    *   2 days
        
*   Practice final presentation and begin making slides
    
    *   3 days
        

Julia:

### Previous Week’s Goals

*   Prioritize addition of "About Me" page for comprehensive user guidance (1 day, by Friday)
    
*   Further update UI design for enhanced user experience (2 days, by Friday)
    
*   Ensure consistency and usability across various screen sizes and resolutions (2 days, by Sunday)
    

### Progress and Issues

This week, I continued to focus on improving the website's user interface and user experience based on our goals. I successfully added the "About Me" page, which aims to provide comprehensive guidance for new users, making it easier for them to navigate and understand the purpose of our application. I also dedicated time to refining the UI's fonts and styling, ensuring that the overall aesthetic is both appealing and functional. A significant addition was the feedback button, which incorporates a thumbs up and down feature, allowing us to gather user feedback directly within the app. Furthermore, I made enhancements to the search bar, redesigning it to be more user-friendly and visually pleasing.

### Plans and Goals

*   Continue working on the UI design, incorporating suggestions and insights from the team to make the application more intuitive and engaging for users (2 days, by Friday).
    
*   Continue refining the UI/UX based on user feedback and results from usability testing. This will include a particular emphasis on improving navigation and accessibility, ensuring that users can easily find what they are looking for and interact with our application without any difficulties (2 days, by Friday).
    
*   Implement responsive design adjustments to ensure the application's performance and appearance are optimized for tablets and mobile devices. This involves testing and tweaking the design to make sure it looks great and functions well across a wide range of screen sizes and resolutions, providing a seamless experience for all users regardless of the device they are using (2 days, by Sunday).
